# Versioning and Branch Strategy

## Branches

- stable-release → stable, production-ready code  
- dev → development and integration  
- feature/name → used to implement specific features  
- hotfix/x.x.x → urgent fixes for stable versions  

---

## Versioning

Format:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Example:

0.1.0

---

## Rules

- PATCH → bug fixes  
  0.1.0 → 0.1.1  

- MINOR → new features  
  0.1.0 → 0.2.0  

- MAJOR → breaking changes or major updates  
  0.2.0 → 1.0.0  

---

## Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from dev  
2. Develop the feature  
3. Merge into dev  
4. Fix and test in dev  
5. Merge dev into stable-release  
6. Tag a new version  

---

## Hotfix

Used for urgent issues in stable-release.

1. Create from stable-release  
   hotfix/0.1.1  

2. Fix the issue  

3. Merge into:
   - stable-release  
   - dev  

4. Release new version:
   0.1.1  

---

## Summary

- feature → create functionality  
- dev → prepare and fix  
- stable-release → final version  

- bug → PATCH  
- feature → MINOR  
- major change → MAJOR  
- urgent bug → HOTFIX (still a PATCH)
